Repo for GitHub API assignments for TCD CSU3012 Software Engineering

## GitHub Access Assignment
For the first assignment I use PyGitHub to connect to the GitHub API and print out all the commit times and messages for one of my public repos (dkocen/CS3012_dev_tasks). The code for this can be found in `githubaccess.py`. For grading please look at commit number: XXXXX

## Dependencies
